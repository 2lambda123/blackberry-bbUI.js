## Building the Sample for your BlackBerry 10 device

The first thing you will want to do is [download WebWorks 2.0](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/download/) and configure your environment (if you haven't done so already) and then open up
the [BlackBerry WebWorks SDK Web Tool](https://developer.blackberry.com/html5/documentation/v2_0/creating_a_webworks_project.html).

Simply import the sample into the tool by providing the file path, and then go to the **Build** area of the tool and compile the application for your device.
